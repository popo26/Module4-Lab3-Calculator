# Exercise 3: Lab – Calculator (Page 39)
Don’t worry about getting the perfect scientific calculator working – try and follow the design process and just follow the instructions on the slide. The base of the application is an app that takes 2 numbers that can do 4 operations (+, /, *, -). Pressing the ‘equals’ button will display the result. Pressing the ‘reset’ button will clear the display.

Try not to use the eval() function – you will see on the MDN there are big security issues therefore we don’t use it, and implementing eval isn’t going to yield you results in terms of your learning.

If in your research and tackling this project you come across calculation libraries - don’t utilize this to do the leg work of your calculation for you. There are similar security issues and you don’t want to ‘cheat’ and let something do the logical parts of your application for you.

### Ensure you do the following:

1. List the requirements, in this case you have a total of 4
requirements
- Get data (two numbers)
- Choose an operator
- Get the result
- Reset the screen

2. Sketch the application, so that you are sure about the
correct functioning.
3. You may use a flow diagram to help.
4. Use a tool of your choice, like Figma, to design the
application.

5. Use the prototype ability and test it.
Develop the application. Start from GIT - it is good practice to do
things in a standard way.
- Create a repository
- Clone the repository locally
- Create a branch for each feature
